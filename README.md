In order to increase the level of passenger satisfaction, I created a highly precise classification model for airlines.
As a result of some simulations, I suggest that airlines should improve the Inflight Wi-Fi Service experience. For example, airlines could improve the software that allows easy access to inflight wi-fi, 
or lower the cost of inflight wi-fi so that more economy class passengers can enjoy the service.
As a result, airlines should also focus on Ease of Online Booking since business passengers prioritize convenience and ease.
